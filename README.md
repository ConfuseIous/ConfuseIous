# Hi, I'm Karandeep Singh.

## I'm a developer, WWDC '22 Swift Student Challenge winner, and Year 2 Information Technology student at Singapore Polytechnic. I make cool things.

## I have 4 apps on the Apple App Store, with another 2 works in progress.

- ### [PlanTask](https://apps.apple.com/app/plantask/id1516651532) - iOS, iPadOS
PlanTask is an intelligent multi-device schedule manager that brings you a new way to think about your schedule - by not thinking about it. PlanTask automatically schedules your tasks for you to make planning effortless. PlanTask also has features such as a widget and recurring tasks.

- ### [PowerToYou](https://confuseious.github.io/PowerToYou) - iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, Android
PowerToYou helps to track the battery level of all your devices in one place and notifies you when any of your devices is low on battery or has finished charging. PowerToYou has over 7500 downloads and counting and has been featured on the iReviews YouTube channel and Stuff Magazine. 

- ### [Status](https://apps.apple.com/app/status-always-on-display/id1614131251) - iOS, iPadOS
The Always On Display is an Android feature that iOS users have been requesting for years, but Apple still has not introduced it. So I built it myself. Status is completely free and fully modular, allowing for full customisation so you can personalise your device to be truly yours.

- ### [BookSwap SG](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/bookswap-sg/id1613060609) - iOS
BookSwap allows you to give away your books and get new ones from others - for free. BookSwap is currently only available in Singapore. For partnership enquiries, please contact me through one of the avenues listed below.
