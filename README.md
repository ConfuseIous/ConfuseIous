# Hi, I'm Karandeep Singh.

I make cool things.

## I have 2 apps on the Apple App Store

- ### [PlanTask](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/plantask/id1516651532) - iOS, iPadOS, watchOS
A free schedule manager like no other on the App Store, some key highlights are the minimalist UI, recurring tasks, automatic deletion of old completed tasks and the usage of iCloud which syncs data seamlessly across all your devices.

- ### [PowerToYou](https://confuseious.github.io/PowerToYou) - iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, Android
A unique app, helpful to owners of multiple devices, PowerToYou helps to track the battery level of all your devices in one place and notifies you when any of your devices is low on battery or has finished charging.
